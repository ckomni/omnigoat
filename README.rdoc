== README

For those who have stumbled upon this repository, this is the infrastructure for my portfolio website in progress. Although I don't see any intrinsic value of this project for anyone other than myself, I do appreciate any constructive notes or advice on building in Rails (keeping in mind that this is unfinished as of 5/27/15).

Please contact me at kylejhalvorson@gmail.com if you have any feedback, or if you are interested in hiring me as a developer or front-end designer.
